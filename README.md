## Branching Strategy

### Branch Naming:
- **Feature Branch:** `ft_<feature_title>_<your_first_name>`
- **Bug Fix Branch:** `bf_<bug_title>_<your_first_name>`
- **Enhancement Branch:** `eh_<enhancement_title>_<your_first_name>`

### Commit Messages:
- Use past tense action verbs followed by an explanation.
- Examples:
  - `Added green button to home page`
  - `Fixed broken routing between task list and task view`

This structure helps maintain a clear and organized workflow for development.
