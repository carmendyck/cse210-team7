    Requirements -- The prioritization algorithm shall use:
    - tradeoff between time left (to complete task) and deadline
    - priority history
    - keywords (test, project, final, midterm, assignment, etc.)

    Dynamic adjustments -- update priorities based on: 
    - past student productivity - (if tasks generally take longer or shorter than expected) â€“ this may be rolled in with task estimation
    - time until deadline - implement urgent decay (priorities increase as deadlines approach)

    Other implementation notes (for version 1)
    - Assign higher priority based on the type of work. (tests have higher priority than HWs?)
    - Closer to the deadline, higher the priority?
    - Starting with heuristics (weighted priority + greedy scheduling).
